# Rustonite
- This is a framework focusing on quantitative trading in the field of cryptocurrency. It supports mainstream exchanges and currencies on the market, is extremely fast, and lightweight.
- It uses Rust to write the core trading components. I regularly use benchmarks to test the speed and usability and compare it with other mainstream platforms.
- At present, this project is just a starting point, and there are still many things to be completed.
- Welcome to put forward any valuable suggestions, your ideas are the basis for making this framework better.
